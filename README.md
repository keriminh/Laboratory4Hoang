Description: This lab assignment requires receiving reference angle and transmitting DC motor's angle and time elasped from and to MATLAB via UART. Addtionally, the assignment requires programming three methods to automatically calibrate the DC motor's angle to be equal to the reference angle, including: On/Off DC motor control (default choice), proportional controller, and proportional-integral controller. Each of those methods can be selected by pressing S3, S4, and S5, respectively.
